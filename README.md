# apple-fonts

This repository contains files for you to download the fonts used by Apple in their devices such as iPhone, Macbook, iPad and more

It should be clear that at no time is this repository plagiarizing Apple. In fact, all of these fonts are taken from Apple's own developer site and these downloads are only available in a more simplified way here. Because on Apple's site, you will have an extra difficulty to download these fonts, even more so if you are using a cell phone or tablet.

If you want to see and get the proof that all this information really has on Apple's own Developer site, just go to the link below.

Apple Developer Site:

*Soon, in this same repository, some other fonts used by Apple will be published for download.*
